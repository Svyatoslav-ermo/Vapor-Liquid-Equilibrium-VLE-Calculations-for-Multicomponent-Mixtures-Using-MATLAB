# Vapor-Liquid-Equilibrium-VLE-Calculations-for-Multicomponent-Mixtures-Using-MATLAB
This project involves creating a MATLAB program for Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) calculations of multicomponent mixtures. It predicts phase compositions using Raoult's Law and the Antoine equation, providing key insights for designing and optimizing separation units in chemical engineering.
